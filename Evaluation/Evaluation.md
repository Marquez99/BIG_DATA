# Evaluation #2

## INSTRUCTIONS

Develop the following instructions in Spark with the programming language Scala, using only the Machine Learning Mllib library documentation from Spark and Google.
1. Load into a dataframe Iris.csv found in https://github.com/jcromerohdz/iris, prepare the necessary data cleaning to be processed by the following algorithm (Important, this cleaning must be by middle of a Scala script in Spark). to. Use the Spark Mllib library the multilayer Machine Learning algorithm
perceptron
2. What are the names of the columns?
3. What is the scheme like?
4. Print the first 5 columns.
5. Use the describe () method to learn more about the data in the DataFrame.
6. Make the pertinent transformation for the categorical data which will be our labels to be classified.
7. Build the classification model and explain its architecture.
8. Print the model results
Evaluation instructions
- Delivery time 4 days
- At the end, put the code and the explanation in the corresponding branch of your github.
his explanation of the solution on his google drive. - Finally defend its development in a video of 8-10 min the
which will serve to give your rating, this video must be uploaded to youtube to be shared by a public link.

## EXPLICATION
It can be concluded that Scala is a very user-friendly programming language. The user who is implementing it, each of its instructions are easy to know and interpret, specifically this CSV helps us to implement various
Scala conditions. As a conclusion in the CSV it can be said that it is an artificial neural network formed by multiple layers, in such a way that it has the ability to solve problems that they are not linearly separable, which is the main limitation of the perceptron.

Interestingly, backpropagation or rather in this practice, iterations that
there are 100 established in the code, it is an algorithm that within this practice evaluative we call it an algorithm or training set in which
transmit the values, and finally the approximation or precision error is calculated, where they spread to the previous layers.

In conclusion, the proximity of the data that was obtained in this evaluative practice was 95% accuracy, reflecting that the MLP was perfectly met in this model that was drawn for the evaluation of this unit.
