# PRACTICE #4

## INSTRUCTIONS

Given the pseudo-code of the Fibonacci sequence in the link provided, implement with Scala Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2, Algorithm 3, Algorithm 4, Algorithm 5

## EXPLICATION
In this practice we perform the fibonnaci algorithm type of algorithm generates a large number of sums, so it is only recommended for small
numbers of n. Inside the function it is observed that recursion is used when sending to call the same function, but modifying the value of n.

To carry out this algorithm, additional libraries were needed to use
of the square root and the empowerment of the numbers, once imported, the It entirely solely lies in the operations that are within the
else clause, assigning values ​​to variables and using multiple operations to reach the goal which is to return the correct Fibonacci value.

The following algorithm performs the initialization of the number to find its number in fibonacci as well as the value of a of 0, b of 1 and c of 0, where with the use of a for It is possible to carry out the value changes of the previous variables, where in each iteration the value of a changes until the fibonacci cycle is completed.

The following algorithm shows how to obtain the number in fibonacci
where in the cycle the sum of the previous variables is performed to obtain the equivalence to get the correct number in variable a.

In the following algorithm it works with an if and else, where the first one is to check if the number is less than 2 then the evaluated number returns, for the else it is define the array that contains the number of rows equal to the number to evaluate plus 1, for the spaces of 0 and 1 the value is previously defined and in the for loop the perform array filling with the sequence the previous positions of each position minus 1 and minus 2 respectively to return the position of the array at the end according to the number to evaluate.
