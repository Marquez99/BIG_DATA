*K-means is a grouping method, which aims to partition a set of n observations into k groups in which each observation belongs to the group whose mean value is closest. It is a method used in data mining.*


On this practice, the development was easy, While sounding complicated, it's not that hard to do. First we create the column named"Hour" utilizing the .withColumn method and send the parameters that contain the name
of the column and the data that is going to be used in that column.
Then we rename the column "Clicked on Ad" as "label" using a select query, similar to theSQL code, where we select the column and rename it using .as. After that we add thecolumns suggested as features of that column so we can get the features that we need.


*`**Logistic Regression is a multivariate statistical technique that allows us to estimate the relationship between a non-metric dependent variable, in particular dichotomous, and a set of independent metric or non-metric variables.**`*
