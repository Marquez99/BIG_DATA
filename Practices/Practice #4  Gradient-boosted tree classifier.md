# Practice #4  Gradient-boosted tree classifier

This practice is straightforward. Decision trees are a popular family of classification and regression methods. ***You can find more information about the spark.ml implementation in the section on decision trees.***

It is a machine learning technique used for regression analysis and statistical classification problems, which produces a predictive model in the form of a set of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stepwise fashion like other boosting methods do, and generalizes them by allowing arbitrary optimization of a differentiable loss function.

Increasing gradient models are becoming popular due to their effectiveness in classifying complex data sets and have recently been used to win many Kaggle data science competitions Regressions are performed when the output of the machine learning model is a real value or a continuous value.
An example of these continuous values ​​would be "weight" or "length".

## An example of a regression task is predicting a person's age based on characteristics such as height, weight, income, etc.
