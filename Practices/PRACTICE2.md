# PRACTICE #2

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Develop a scala algorithm that calculates the radius of a circle

2. Develop a scala algorithm that tells me if a number is prime

3. Given the variable var bird = "tweet", use string interpolation to
    print "I'm writing a tweet"

4. Given the variable var message = "Hi Luke, I'm your father!" uses slice to extract the
    sequence "Luke"

5. What is the difference between value (val) and a variable (var) in scala?

6. Given the tuple (2,4,5,1,2,3,3,1416,23) returns the number 3.1416

## EXPLICATION
This practice is simple, since the “readLine” library is imported first to be able to make use of the readline so that you can save its value and in this way be able to readthe values ​​entered from the command line.

Then inside the function is the program logic, where you use
println to display messages and "var" to declare variables. Finally
the function is called to carry out the task in question. 

For part number two a function is used again to encompass the logic
program overview. The println function is used to display messages in
console and the "readInt" function to dynamically read user values.
Then the if is used to control the decisions made, and the operator
modulus (%) to determine whether a number is odd or not.

In step number three it consists of entering a value within a string of string existing, and the second line shows how it is carried out. Add as before opening double quotes, and the place where you want to enter that variable the $ symbol is added, this way it is displayed as a string string normal.

Now in the next step the variable that contains the message is declared, it is used the Scala method that allows obtaining a section of a string this from a Initial index and another final one that determines the specific substring to obtain.

Finally, the tuple variable that contains a set of numbers is declared where the intention is to get one of the specific numbers, once the variablE is declared the “._ {number}” is used, the number is specified according to the index within the defined set.
