# PRACTICE #3

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Create a list called "list" with the elements "red", "white", "black"

2. Add 5 more items to "list" "green", "yellow", "blue", "orange", "pearl"

3. Bring the items from "list" "green", "yellow", "blue"

4. Create an array of numbers in the range 1-1000 in steps of 5 by 5

5. What are the unique elements of the list List (1,3,3,4,6,7,3,7) use conversion to sets

6. Create a mutable map named names that contains the following
     "Jose", 20, "Luis", 24, "Ana", 23, "Susana", "27"
   6 a. Print all keys on the map
   6 b. Add the following value to the map ("Miguel", 23)

## EXPLICATION

Like the previous practice it is something simple, since a variable is declared mutable where we enter the previous colors. In this case the ": +" is used to add an element in the previous list, consists of renewing the elements of the main list variable which changes as new elements are added.

The simple way to display an item from a list is to specify between
parentheses the index of the item to search for.

An array is created, but with its range function, which, among its properties, is the allow to create arrangements with jumps that the user decides, in this case, as Second parameter is passed a 5 so that they are jumps from 5 to 5.

Lists have a function called toSet, which acts in the same way as
"Set" when used in a data array, so only its function is accessed
and returns a set of non-repeating numbers within the list.
It is from "collection.mutable" in this way it makes a map mutable, in others words, which can be modified. You access the "keys" function contained within from the maps and lists the existing keys.

As it is mutable, through the expression “+ =” another value can be added to a map.
